    "# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented Programming is a way of structuring your code in a way that both characteristics and behaviours of data can be bundled together into a single structure. This single structure then allows you to use this again and again throughout your code. Consequently you can create new objects throughout your code to store data and perform specific functions. This is in contrast to procedural programming which follows a sequence of steps in order to complete a task using functions and code blocks which is the tradition in Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very useful when it comes to storing data that you want to also bundle associated actions with as it allows you to utilise the base definition/blueprint again and again. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an application for this could be for a firm where you have multiple employees. For each employee you would want to store basic information such as: current wage, years worked for the firm, current grade and potentially their birthday. However, you may want to also add functions that allow you to change this information such as giving them a promotion, a wage increase or if they leave the firm. By creating an employee class you can store all this data and perform these functions all as part of one object per employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this is done is by creating classes which are used as blueprints for objects. The class descirbed overall what the object will be, but is seperate from the object itself. "

    "## Defining a class \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do for this is to define a class.  This is a structure that describes essentially what the object will be and acts as a blueprint. This can be used again and again to create multiple different objects that take the same structure, have the same attributes and perform the same functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are created using the keyword <b>class</b> and are followed by an indented block which contains methods (which are essentially the same as functions). An example of this would be as follows:"

In this case, this is the <b>employee</b> class. Naming these classes takes on a certain convention known as [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#:~:text=Camel%20case%20(stylized%20as%20camelCase,word%20starting%20with%20either%20case.) which essentially means that instead of `_` seperating words (as in the case of snake case), the beginning of words are capitalised like we have with Employee here.\n",
